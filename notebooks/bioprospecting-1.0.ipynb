    "A Biosynthetic Gene Cluster (BGC) can be defined as a physically clustered group of two or more genes that encode the biosynthetic enzymes of a pathway (Medema 2015). The compounds encoded by BGCs represent diverse chemical structural classes, which include among others, polyketides, peptides, oligosaccharides, terpenoids, and alkaloids. These are commonly known as natural products and are a rich source of molecule candidates for the development of pharmaceutical applications, for instance, as vitamins, antibiotics, and antifungals (Newman and Cragg 2020). In addition, from an ecological perspective, natural  product BGCs are traits with key roles for the organisms’ survival and adaptation to the environment, participating in defense, nutrient scavenging, quorum sensing, etc (Fischbach and Voigt 2010; O’Brien and Wright 2011)."
